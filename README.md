must have a 'users' Model then 2 more after that.

ERD 


possible ideas:

find a taco truck near me... 
 - have accounts with trucks they've tried with reviews, trucks they want to try... 

models will be 
    user
    - user location.
    - trucks they want to try 
    - trucks they have tried
    - ?? stuff off the menu of that truck they have tried ??
    - favorite truck
    - favorite tacos 

    truck
    - photo of the truck
    - address 
    - menu 
    - ?? reviews ?? 



create a random pub crawl route...


resturants to try app - could use 3rd party API
resturant review blog

local things to do in town. 
    - have users share fun things to do locally 
    - optionally have small town API to get things to do
